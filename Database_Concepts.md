- ER (Entity-Relationship) Modeling
  - Basic components: Entity, Attribute, Relationship
- Conceptual Design
  - Corresponds to the conceptual level of the ANSI/SPARC architecture
  - Independent of all physical implementation considerations

- Logical Design
  - Develop a data model which targets a particular database model
  - Independent of any implementation details which are specific to any particular vendors DBMS package
  - Normalisation technique is uesd to test the correctness of a relational logical model

- Physical Design
  - Choose appropriate storage structures, indexes, file organizations and access methods which will most efficiently support the user requirements
  - dependent on the particular DBMS environment in use
  - ANSI/SPARC internal level
- Connecitivity

- Weak vs Strong Entity
  - Strong entity: has a key which may be defined without reference to other entities
  - Weak entity: has a key which requires the existence of one or more other entities
  - Database designer often determines whether an entity can be described as weak based on business rules
- Identifying vs Non-Identifying Relationship

- Types of Attributes
  - Simple: cannot be subivided
  - Composite: can be subdivided into additional attributes
  - Single-valued: can have only a single value
  - Multi-valued: can have many values
  - Derived: can be derived with algorithm
  - Attribute classification is driven by client requirments
