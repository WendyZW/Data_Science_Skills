### Advanced
- CASE statement
  - The CASE statement used in the select list enables the query to evaluate an attribute and output a particular value based on that evaluation
- Subquery
  - the subquery is independent of the outer query and is executed only once.
  - the subquery is related to the outer query and is evaluated once for each row of the outer query
  - correlated subqueries can also be used within update statements
    - outer update occurs based on value returned from subquery
- Views
  - A virtual table derived from one or more base tables
  - Sometimes used as "Access Control" to the database
- Self Join
  - Show the name of the manager for each employee.
- Set Operators
  - Using the set operators you can combine two or more sets to create new sets (relations)
  - Union All
    - All rows selected by either query, including all duplicates
  - Union
    - All rows selected by either query, removing duplicates (e.g,, DISTINCT on Union All)
  - Intersect
    - All distinct rows selected by both queries
  - Minus
    - All distinct rows selected by the first query but not by the second
  - All set operators have equal precedence. If a SQL statement contains multiple set operators, Oracle evaluates them from the left to right if no parentheses explicitly specify another order.
  - The two sets must be UNION COMPATIBLE (i.e., same number of attributes and similar data types)
- MINUS
- UNION
- INTERSECTION
