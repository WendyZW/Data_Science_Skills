### SQL Intermediate
- Aggregate Functions
  - COUNt, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG
- GROUP BY
  - If a GROUP BY clause is used with aggregate function, the DBMS will apply the aggregate function to the different groups defined in the clause rather than all rows.
- HAVING
  - It is used to put a condition or conditions on the groups defined by GROUP BY clause.
- HAVING and WHERE clauses
  - SELECT unit_code, count(\*) FROM enrolment WHERE mark IS NULL GROUP BY unit_code HAVING count(*) > 1;
  - The WHERE clause is applied to ALL rows in the table.
  - The HAVING clause is applied to the groups defined by the GROUP BY clause.
  - The order of operations performed is FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING and then ORDER BY.
  - On the above example, the logic of the process will be:
    - All rows where mark is NULL are retrieved. (due to the WHERE clause)
    - The retrieved rows then are grouped into different unit_code.
    - If the number of rows in a group is greater than 1, the unit_code and the total is displayed. (due to the HAVING clause)
- Subqueries
  - Query within a query
- Comparison Operators for Subquery
  - Operator for single value comparison. =, <, >
  - Operator for multiple rows or a list comparison.
    - equality
      - IN
    - inequality
      - ALL, ANY combined with <, >
