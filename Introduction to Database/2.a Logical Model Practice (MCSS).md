### Question
Monash Computing Students Society (MCSS) is one of the student clubs at Monash University.\
Students are welcome to join as a member. When a student joins MCSS, a member id is assigned, and the students first name, last name, date of birth, email and phone number will be recorded. This club has an annual membership fee. When a member has paid the membership fee for the current year, the current year is recorded against the year of membership as part of their membership details.\
MCSS hosts several events throughout the year. The events are currently categorised into Professional Events, General Events, and Social Events. MCSS would like to be able to add further categories as they develop new events. When an event is scheduled, MCSS assigns an event id to the event. The event date and time, description, location, allocated budget, the ticket price and the discount rate (eg 5%) for members. Some events are organised as free events for members. In this situation, the discount rate is recorded as 100% for members. For all events, only members can purchase the tickets. However, members can buy additional tickets for their friends or family at full price. For each of the sales, the receipt number, number of tickets sold, total amount paid and the member id are recorded.\
Some events attract some sponsorships. The sponsor may be an organisation or an individual. The sponsors provide financial support to the event. Some events may have several sponsors. The amount of financial support provided by each sponsor is recorded for the event. Each sponsor is identified by a sponsor id. The name, contact email and sponsor type are also recorded. A sponsor may support several events throughout the year.\
For some events such as career night, MCSS may also invite some guest speakers to share their experience. The database records all guests’ information, the guests full name, email and phone number are recorded. If a guest comes from an organisation or an individual that provides a sponsorship to any of the MCSS events (does not have to be at the event where the guest speaks), this fact will also be recorded. A guest may be invited to several events.\
