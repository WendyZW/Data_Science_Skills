- SQL general syntax
  - A single statement is ended with semicolon
  - Predefined keywords represent clauses (components) of a statement
  - Keywords are NOT case sensitive
- SQL Statements
  - Data Definition Language (DDL)
    - Creating database structure
      - CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE
    - Data Manipulation Language (DML)
      - Adding and Manipulating database contents (rows)
        - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
      - Retrieving data from database
        - SELECT
  - Data Control Language (DCL)
    - Set permissions on objects
      - GRANT
- Common ORACLE data types
  - Text: CHAR(size), VARCHAR2(size)
    - e.g., CHAR(10), VARCHAR2(10)
    - CHAR(10) → ‘apple’ = ‘apple ‘
    - VARCHAR2(10) → ‘apple’ != ‘apple ‘
  - Numbers: NUMBER(precision, scale)
    - Weight NUMBER(7) or NUMBER(7,0) → Weight = 7456124
    - Weight NUMBER(9,2) → Weight = 7456123.89
    - Weight NUMBER(8,1) → Weight = 7456123.9
  - Data/Time: DATE, TIMESTAMP
    - DATE can store a date and time (time to seconds), stored as Julian date
    - TIMESTAMP can store a date and a time (up to fractions of a second)
    - TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- Referential Integrity
  - To ensure referential integrity, SQL defines three possible actions for FKs in relations when a deletion of a primary key occurs:
    - RESTRICT (Oracle No Action basically equivalent)
      - Deletion of tuples is NOT ALLOWED for those tuples in the table referred by the FK (the table containing PK) if there is corresponding tuple in the table containing the FK.
    - CASCADE
      - A deletion of a tuple in the table referred by the FK (the table containing PK) will result in the deletion of the corresponding tuples in the table containing the FK.
    - NULLIFY
      - A deletion of a tuple in the table referred by the FK (the table containing PK) will result in the update of the corresponding tuples in the table containing the FK to NULL. 
- ALTER TABLE
  - Used to change a tables structure
  - For example:
    - Adding columns
    - Removing columns
    - Adding constraints
    - Removing constraints
- Deleting a Table
  - Use the DROP statement
- INSERT
  - Adding data to a table in a database
  - INSERT INTO table [(column[, column...])] VALUES (value [, value...]);
- COMMIT and ROLLBACK
  - COMMIT makes the changes to the database permanent
  - ROLLBACK will undo the changes
- Using a SEQUENCE
  - Oracle supports auto-increment of a numeric PRIMARY KEY
    - SEQUENCE
  - Steps to use:
    - Create sequence
      - CREATE SEQUENCE sno_seq INCREMENT BY 1;
    - Access the sequence using two built-in variables (pseudocolumns):
      - NEXTVAL and CURRVAL
        - INSERT INTO student VALUES(sno_seq.nextval,'Bond','James','01-Jan-1994’);
        - INSERT INTO enrolment VALUES(sno_seq.currval,’FIT9132’,...’);
